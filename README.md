# Movies_API
A web application using the fetch() API method to retrieve movies from 'Studio Ghibli'. This web applications uses HTTP requests to make a request to this website and get the movies to the user. 
In other words, I am working with JSON data (movies), retrieving it from the web server(Studio Ghibli website) and serving it as Javascript data (response.data) to the user in the DOM.
